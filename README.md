## The Rules of Engagement

1. Teams take their places at opposing ends of the battlefield
* Teams take turns having one member throw a frisbee from any point behind their **Throw Line** towards the poles of the opposing team's side.
* Points are scored if the frisbee does any of the following:
    * Strike a cup, causing it to fly off the pole and land on the ground
        * **1 Point**
    * Strike a pole, causing it to shake the cup off the pole, and land on the ground
        * **1 Point**
    * Pass between both poles without contacting either cup or pole.
        * **2 Points**
